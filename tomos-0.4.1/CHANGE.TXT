** TomOS-0.4.1 03 March 2009

# FAT12 bug fixed
  DIR command was listing deleted files.
  Thanks to StalinPL for founding the bug.

** TomOS-0.4 28 February 2009

# FAT12 support for directories.
  Only available through CLI.
  It is possible to see a directory content
  and change a working directory.

# Build-in command DIR was removed from CLI.
  Now 'DIR' is an external program.

# New program 'CD' to change a working directory

# Add a new build-in command 'FREE'.
  Shows available memory. In TomOS-0.4 only 8164 bytes.
  Used to finding memory leaks.

# Command line passed to the executed program
  see the os_command_line_get systemcall.

# New systemcalls
    - os_dir_open
    - os_dir_close
    - os_dir_change
    - os_dir_next_file
    - os_command_line_get
    - os_file_convert_d2f
    - os_file_convert_f2d
    - os_char_uppercase
    - os_char_lowwercase
    - os_string_not_find_char

# Changes in existing systemcalls
    - os_string_find_char
    - os_int_to_string

# Fixed a bug in the TomOS memory manager
 caused a crash of the system after freeing memory.

# Fixed a bug in os_memory_copy.
  

** TomOS-0.3 13 February 2009

# Modified the building script.

# Modified the code responsible for FAT12 read/write
  divided into smaller pieces to make it easier to
  understand. 

# Small fixes


** TomOS-0.1 27 December 2008

# IMPORTANT  !!!! TomOS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH MikeOS !!!!. (will be fixed)

# Reorganized the directory structure.

# Removed all programs written for MikeOS because incompatibility with TomOS
  They will come back in TomOS-0.4.0

# Moved all system calls to the interupt 47h. 
  Now calling system call is done using macro 'syscall' 
  declared in include/sycalls.inc. Every systemcall has own ID
  declared in include/syscalls.inc. The file automaticly included during
  a compilation.

# Changed the keyboard handling derived from MikeOS.
  Uses keyboard buffer. see the 'os_kbd_get_char' subroutine.

# Added simple a memory manager (see source/os_mm.asm)
  Now it is possible to allocate memory by applications.
  Available the last 8KB of TomOS segment. (will be extended)

# Fixed os_string_strip - do not use os_buffer

# Added new macros (include/tomos.inc)

# Changed names of few system calls to unified them.

# Aded os_memory_copy , os_memory_set (see source/syscalls.asm).

# Unified way of commenting source code. (see tools/docgen)

# New documantation generated from comments by program docgen
  To find out how to comment source code see doc/DOCGEN.TXT

# TomOS provides a compilation script only for GNU/Linux operating system.

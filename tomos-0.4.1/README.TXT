TomOS is a 16-bit real mode operating system for x86-compatible PCs 
based on MikeOS hosted by berlios on http://mikeos.berlios.de/.

TomOS is written entirely in assembly language, which boots from a 
floppy disk or CD-ROM. It features a text-based dialog-driven user interface,
a command-line, support for FAT12 (MS-DOS-like) floppy disks, mice and
sound via the PC speaker. The kernel includes over 70 system calls,
and is also capable of running very basic DOS .COM programs.

TomOS is designed as a learning tool for those wishing to understand
simple OS construction and x64 assembly. Quick getting-started guide:
TomOS can run from a floppy disk or CD-ROM, either on an emulator or
a real PC. See the bin/iso or bin/img  directory for files that you can write
to the approprate media. You can run the ISO image in an emulator such
as QEMU, VMware or VirtualBox; for a real PC, burn it to a CD-R and
boot from it.

Have fun!

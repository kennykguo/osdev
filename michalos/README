MichalOS Readme
***************

A 16-bit operating system based on MikeOS 4.5, aimed to be more advanced and lightweight on the inside, but simple and easy to use on the outside.

System requirements:
	- Intel 80386 or higher, Pentium recommended
	- At least 80 kB RAM, 256 kB recommended
	- An EGA card
	- A keyboard
	
Building the OS
***************

Note: These instructions work only on Linux (and possibly Mac?) systems.

If you use Windows, please install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).
To properly compile under WSL, you will have to have DOSBox installed on Windows
and create a Bash script under WSL in /bin/dosbox (and don't forget to "chmod +x" it!):

	#!/bin/bash
	"/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/DOSBox-0.74-3/DOSBox.exe" $@

Required packages: make nasm dosfstools dosbox mtools mkisofs

For Ubuntu/Debian systems, run: 

	sudo apt-get install make nasm dosfstools dosbox mtools mkisofs

For WSL, run the same command, just omit dosbox:

	sudo apt-get install make nasm dosfstools mtools mkisofs

It is also necessary to install the zx7 compressor utility:

	cd misc/zx7
	sudo ./build.sh

To build: open the terminal, navigate to the directory that contains MichalOS and run:
	make

If you want to force-rebuild everything, run:
	make force
	
If you want to get rid of all of the built pieces, run:
	make clean

If you just want to boot the image without rebuilding, run:
	make boot

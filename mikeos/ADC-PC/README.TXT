
            A Kids Level Analogue To Digital Project For MikeOS.
            ----------------------------------------------------

This project was developed for MikeOS, (an Operating System, (OS), designed
as a teaching aid as to how OSs work and are developed). It is a simple ADC,
(Analogue to Digital Converter), that works through the Parallel Port running
in Standard Mode. This makes the project compliant with ALL PC Parallel Ports
and therefore usable on old machines as well as this current Quad Core
machine of mine that I develop on. And YES, this current machine, 07-01-2010,
has got a Parallel Port, AND, Serial Port; (in another project the Serial
Port is going to be used to demonstrate Arduino Board access, so that you can
create projects of your own).

The ADC is built on Stripboard/Veroboard to allow youngsters the chance to
have a go without the need for special tools or board making extras. :)

The ADC Integrated Circuit, (IC), is a "ADC0804LCN" and is readily available
from various sources in a DIL, (Dual In-Line), package. It is very, very
cheap and tolerant to user "abuse", therefore almost indestructable!  ;oO
(Sweeping statement!... :)

With the absolute limitations of the OS itself, AND, the BASIC interpreter
itself you will see that EVEN with these limitations something serious CAN
be developed for it.

This project will culminate into a simple 0 - 5 Volt Voltmeter in this case,
BUT, with some simple BASIC code additions and alterations, along with extra
home built add-on hardware, can become an, Ammeter, Powermeter, Thermometer,
etc......

Now have some childish fun and learn how to build stuff for yourself, both
hardware, AND, software wise...

Enjoy finding simple solutiuons to often very difficult problems... :)

                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the computer before disconnecting or connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.

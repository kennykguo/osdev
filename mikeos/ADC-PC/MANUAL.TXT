          Construction And Operation Manual For The ADC On MikeOS.
          --------------------------------------------------------

  Preface:-
  ---------

Apologies to everyone for any typos and/or grammatical errors that may be
inside this manual as it was not spell ckecked nor grammar checked. If there
are any serious errors then contact me on my Email aaddress at the end of
this manual.

Every effort has been made to be as accurate as possible in the building of
this project and I have checked amd rechecked the important sections and I
am unable to see any construction errors. Now have fun with this tool and
start doing things for yourself... :)

This project was developed for MikeOS, (an Operating System, (OS), designed
as a teaching aid as to how OSs work and are developed). It is a simple ADC,
(Analogue to Digital Converter), that works through the Parallel Port running
in Standard Mode. This makes the project compliant with ALL PC Parallel Ports
and therefore usable on old machines as well as this current Quad Core
machine of mine that I develop on. And YES, this current machine, 07-01-2010,
has got a Parallel Port, AND, Serial Port; (in another project the Serial
Port is going to be used to demonstrate Arduino Board access, so that you can
create projects of your own).

The ADC is built on Stripboard/Veroboard to allow youngsters the chance to
have a go without the need for special tools or board making extras. :)

The ADC Integrated Circuit, (IC), is a(n) ~ADC0804LCN~ and is readily
available from various sources in a DIL, (Dual In-Line), package. It is very,
very cheap and tolerant to user "abuse", therefore almost indestructable! ;oO
(Sweeping statement!... :)

With the absolute limitations of the OS itself, AND, the BASIC interpreter
itself you will see that EVEN with these limitations something serious CAN
be developed for it.

This project will culminate into a simple 0 - 5 Volt Voltmeter in this case,
BUT, with some simple BASIC code additions and alterations, along with extra
home built add-on hardware, can become an, Ammeter, Powermeter, Thermometer,
etc......

Now have some childish fun and learn how to build stuff for yourself, both
hardware, AND, software wise...

Enjoy finding simple solutiuons to often very difficult problems... :)

Bazza, G0LCU... :)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Where To Start:-
  ----------------

This project uses standard tools and methods to build it. If you are unsure
about using a soldering iron and other basic tools then go to your local
library for more information on the subjects. IF you have access to the WWW,
(World Wide Web), then searching for information will be made easy using
a search facility, (engine), such as GOOGLE.

NOTE...

This is primarily aimed at the youngster of around 10 years of age, but hey,
anyone is invited to build it and learn how to do things for themselves
instead of having everything already done for them...

No serious knowledge of electronics is required, but it is expected that a
electrical and mechanical safety is known about and adhered to. However it
is assumed that you can read a simple circuit diagram however and build from
that circuit on to stripboard or Veroboard without the aid of drawings.

This project DOES have photographs of the stripboard layout but not drawn
layouts as I feel that the photo`s are enough to get you going.

As for MikeOS this project was originally developed for Version 4 but at the
time of writing Version 4.1b1 has arrived so it should work on that too
without any changes.

Enjoy...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Roughly, How Does It Work:-
  ---------------------------

Because Standard Parallel Ports, (SPP), cannot accept 8, (eight), bit data
through the DATA lines as INPUT then only the dedicated STATUS lines can be
used. The problem is that there are only 4, (four), useful lines that can be
used for this project.

I decided not to use a serial type ADC like TLC549 because I didn`t have one
but I had a(n) ADC0804LCN parallel connected type in my junk box instead.
At the time of writing see:-

  http://www.intersil.com/data/fn/fn3094.pdf

For more information on the ADC0804LCN IC and how it works...

If you are not sure how Analogue to Digital Conversion is done and want to
know more then here is a good starting point, also at the time of writing...

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter

The CD4019BCN is used to give 2, (two), lots of 4, (four), bits, also known
as NIBBLEs, into the above STATUS lines; that is bits 4, 5, 6 and 7 as the
first chunk and bits 0, 1, 2 and 3 as the second chunk. These two chunks can
be software controlled back into an 8 bit data byte again identical to the 8
bit lines an the ADC IC.
Also at the time of writing see:-

  http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheets/70/108826_DS.pdf

For more information on the CD4019BCN IC and how it works...

Only the STATUS and CONTROL registers of the SPP are used, the DATA register
is ignored. The STATUS register is used to grab the 8 bit data in two NIBBLEs
and the CONTROL register is used to control the ADC0804LCN and the CD4019BCN
to do this task. The assembly code at the end of this manual describes the
process further, so read that section for more information.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Some Basic Construction Information:-
  -------------------------------------

(This may seem a little childish, but remember, it IS aimed at 10 year olds.)

Refer to the ~BRDLOWER.JPG~, ~BRDUPPER.JPG~ and ~ADC-PC.BMP~ photo`s and
drawings for more information. Although not perfect you should be able to
work out the/your positions from these images.

HANDLE ALL TOOLS, CHEMICALS, SOLVENTS AND MAINS POWERED GEAR WITH CARE!!!

Remember to ~tin~ the ends of the wires, components, etc using the soldering
iron and solder before fitting!

  THIS BIT IS IMPORTANT!!!
  ------------------------

BE WELL AWARE, that when counting the strip and hole positions for fitting
the items to the board that you count from the CORRECT EDGE(S) when viewing
the board images from the UPPER side to the LOWER side.

  The Construction Proper:-
  -------------------------

  1) Set up a prepared area to work; this might sound obvious but the number
     of people I see soldering and drilling, etc, in dangerous positions and
     places risking their lives and/or limbs is staggering - SO BEWARE!
  2) Using the Stanley knife cut a piece of stripborad to 36 strips by 26
     holes. Once cut use the file to trim the cut edge, (and radius the
     corners if required).
  3) Using the drill bit remove the copper from the strips as viewed in the
     ~BRDLOWER.JPG~ image. Do not go right through the board. This is easily
     done using your fingers; therefore a drilling tool is NOT required.
  4) From now on refer to the ~BRDLOWER.JPG~, ~BRDUPPER.JPG~ and
     ~ADC-PC.BMP~ images.
  5) Using a soldering iron, solder, (and side cutters), fit the two IC
     holders and solder into their correct places with reference to the
     images above.
  6) Fit and solder the copper wire links and cut off any excess copper
     wire.
  7) Fit and solder the four resistors, one capacitor and one variable
     resistor into place and cut off any excess wire.
  8) Fit the two zener diodes, carefully solder into place and cut off any
     excess wire. NOTE:- Make sure the polarity of these zener diodes is
     correct and in their correct places.
  9) Using coloured wire of your choice strip the ends, tin, fit and solder
     differing colours to the board and cut off any excess copper strands,
     then strip, tin and solder the other ends of the correct wires to the
     correct pins of the 25 way ~D~ type plug; from experience it is best
     to complete EACH wire fitting at both ends when you are a beginner.
     Do NOT fit the ~D~ type shell yet!
 10) Using a short length of mono` audio coaxial cable, strip the sleeving
     off one end. Separate the braid from the inner conductor and clean up.
     (Optionally place a short length of small diameter heat shrink sleeving
     over the whole cable diameter.)
 11) Refit the cut off sleeving over the coaxial cable braid leaving enough
     braid to be tinned and fitted to the board.
     (Optionally place the heat shrink sleeving over the ~Y~ joint and using
     the hair drier shrink this sleeving into place.)
 12) Fit and solder this prepared end of the coaxial cable to the correct
     places on the board and cut off any excess wire.
 13) Disassemble a PHONO socket and place the barrel over the cable.
 14) Strip the sleeving off of the opposite end to the one that has already
     been fitted and separate the braiding from the inner conductor.
 15) Trim, tin and solder the inner conductor to the inner pin of the PHONO
     socket and tin and solder the braiding to the outer section, GND, of
     the socket. Do NOT fit the barrel of the PHONO socket back to the socket
     as yet.
 16) Fit the two ICs to their respective sockets with care. Be aware of
     damage due to electrostatic effects and ensure they are the correct way
     round in their sockets.
 17) Optionally use cable ties and stick on cable clips to finish off.
 18) Thoroughly check all of your construction work from part 3) onwards.
 19) Check it again.
 20) Check it a third time, REMEMBER!, any error could cause serious damage
     to the computer so be well aware of this.
 21) If all is well then go to part 22), otherwise correct any error that
     you have found and go back to part 18).
 22) Now finally fit the barrel of the PHONO socket to the socket itself and
     fit the ~D~ type shell to the 25 way ~D~ type plug.
 23) Now carry on with the Added Circuit below...

=============================================================================

               Added Circuit To The ADC Stripboard Assembly.
               ---------------------------------------------

A 9 Volt DC to 5 Volt DC regulated dropper circuit for the MikeOS project.
It is added to the board to give an independant supply to the board as PCs
do not have a 5 Volt continuous output to run the ADC reliably.

  2) All components can be sourced from any supplier.
  3) Items 7), 8) and 9) are optional.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Tools Required:-
  ----------------

  1) Soldering iron, (be very careful with this).
  2) Solder.
  3) Side cutters.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Construction Of The Added Components:-
  --------------------------------------

Refer to the ~BRDLOWER.JPG~, ~BRDUPPER.JPG~ and ~ADC-PC.BMP~ photo`s and
drawings for more information. Although not perfect you should be able to
work out the positions from these images.

Refer also to the earlier safety, etc conditions on building this project
before continuing.

  1) Fit the capacitors C1 and C2 and solder into place. NOTE:- Make sure
     the polarity of these capacitors is correct!!!
  2) Fit the tinned copper wire links as required and solder into place.
  3) Fit the PP3 battery terminal assembly to the correct positions and
     solder into place.
  4) Finally fit the regulator IC and solder into place. NOTE:- Make sure
     that this IC is fitted the correct way round!!!

The construction of the whole assembly is now finalised and ready for initial
checking and testing. A ~Test Lead~ WILL be needed and is described below...

=============================================================================

                       Construction Of The Test Lead.
                       ------------------------------

  Parts Required:-
  ----------------

  1) A length of coaxial cable approximately 1.5 metres, RG58 or UR76.
  2) A PHONO or RCA plug.
  3) A countersunk head brass screw approximately 1.5" (37mm) long.
  4) A matching nut.
  5) An insulated crocodile clip.
  6) A length of sleeving, (the sleeving off of the coaxial cable will do).
  7) An old ballpoint pen case cut down to about 3" to 4" long, see text.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Tools Required:-
  ----------------

  1) Soldering iron.
  2) Solder.
  3) Side cutters.
  4) Small pliers.
  5) A flat file.
  6) A hobby saw.
  7) PVC tape.
  8) Superglue, (be very careful with this).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Refer to the drawings ~PROBE.GIF~ and ~PROBE.JPG~ for further information.

Strip at least 6" to 9" of sleeving off of one end of the coaxial cable.
Do NOT discard this sleeving. Separate the braid from the inner conductor.
Solder the inner conductor to the head of the brass countersunk-head screw.
  
Place the sleeving over the braiding before fitting the crocodile clip and
then wrap some PVC tape around the ~Y~ joint of the cable. Solder the
crocodile clip to the braiding. Dismantle an old ballpoint pen to obtain the
case. Discard all of the inner parts of the pen.

Before reassembling the screw into the ballpoint pen case, cut the case down
to a practical length, (approximately 3" to 4"). Fit the PHONO, (RCA), plug
to the other end of the coaxial cable, inner conductor to the pin, the braid
to the outer part of the plug. The head of the screw may need to be filed
narrower to fit inside the ballpoint pen case.

When you have checked this cable and are confident it is electrically good
use the superglue to seal the top of the pen case and the nut. Do NOT get
this glue on you or anything else as it is dangerous. Allow time to dry.

NOTE:- The photograph shows a BNC plug fitted with a BNC-PHONO adapter
connected. If you feel confident in doing it this way then do so.

=============================================================================

  Testing And Calibration:-
  -------------------------

Ensure that a copy of ~CALIBRAT.BAS~, ~PARAPORT.BAS~ and ~PARAPORT.DAT~ is
on a copy of a MikeOS floppy disk. I chose this mode for ease of access.

This project only works on machines with a parallel port in SPP, (Standard
Parallel Port), mode.

You WILL need the Duracel 1.5 Volt cell for this test proceedure...

  1) Thoroughly check all of your construction work.
  2) Check it again.
  3) Check it a third time, REMEMBER!, any error could cause serious damage
     to the computer so be well aware of this.
  4) If all is well then go to part 5), otherwise correct any error that you
     have found and go back to part 1).
  5) Ensure the computer is powered down, (OFF).
  6) Set the preset variable resistor, RV1, on the board, to the fully
     anticlockwise position.
  7) Connect the Test Lead to the PHONO, (RCA), input socket.
  8) Connect a PP3 battery to the battery connector.
  9) Connect the 25 way ~D~ type plug into the parallel port.
 10) I now assume that a floppy disk and drive are available for simplicity,
     see above.
 11) Boot into MikeOS 4.0x or above and run ths OS as normal.
 12) Start the editor and then load in ~CALIBRAT.BAS~.
 13) Press F8 to run the program.
 14) With nothing connected to the input the value(s) 0, (to 2), should be
     displayed. IF NOT then power down the computer, disconnect the board
     from the parallel port, disconnect the battery and then go back to 1).
 15) IF ALL IS OK, connect the 1.5 Volt Duracel battery, +ve to the PROBE
     tip and -ve to the crocodile clip.
 16) The reading should now be somewhere between 40 and 100. It does not
     matter if the reading is slightly out of that range.
 17) Remove the Duracel 1.5 Volt battery and connect the probe tip to the
     +ve 5 Volt supply line.
 18) The reading should now be somewhere between 100 and 255.
 19) Replace the probe tip to the +ve 9 Volt supply input of the PP3 battery.
 20) The reading should now be fixed at 255.
 21) IF ALL is well then, WELL DONE!!!
     Your project is now ready for calibration at part 22)......
 22) Now re-connect the 1.5 Volt Duracel battery, +ve to the PROBE tip and
     -ve to the crocodile clip.
 23) Adjust the preset variable resistor, RV1, to give a value of 80 + or -
     1 on the calibration software.
 24) WELL DONE! Your Analogue To Digital Converter, ADC, is now ready for
     proper use in future projects. I hope to start a Data Loger/Transient
     Recorder as soon as possible.
 25) Power down the computer and dsiconnect the ADC board and the boards
     peripheral bits and pieces.

The next project will probably be an AF Power Meter, 0 to 100 Watts RMS.
Look out for it in the near future...

=============================================================================

The Analogue To Digital Converter is now complete as a project in itself and
all that is required is to build the extras along with any BASIC code to run
them.

Now take this hardware that you have built and think of uses it can be used
for. As it stands, with simple home built add-on hardware and simple BASIC
code, there are many!!!

=============================================================================

  Notes On The Code:-
  -------------------

All the code in this archive is Public Domain, (PD). You can do with it as
you wish except respect the (C) for the idea by myself. There are three code
segments:-

  1) CALIBRAT.BAS ......  This is the calbration software to set up the ADC
                          when it is finished.
  2) PARAPORT.BAS ......  This is the running software and demonstrates a
                          simple analogue bar graph using standard CGA Text
                          Mode 3.
  3) PARAPORT.ASM ......  This is the assembly code and is MikeOS compliant.
                          It was compiled using the A86/D86 combination for
                          MS-DOS and when compiled it was renamed......
  4) PARAPORT.DAT ......  This is the machine language subroutine to access
                          the parallel port in SPP, (Standard Parallel Port),
                          mode. (It works on my Quad Core 2.4GHz tool fine.)

BEWARE!!! The assembler code assumes the most common I/O, (Inout/Ouput),
addresses for the parallel port. There are others, so check that yours are
correct before running this code at all. The parallel port addresses used in
this project are, (DATA - unused at 0x378h), STATUS at 0x379h and CONTROL at
0x37Ah. IF yours are different then change the assembly code to suit and
re-compile. There should be no change to the BASIC code however.

All the remarks inside the code should be enough to describe what is going on
when the program is run.

When running the PARAPORT.BAS code, ONLY the 0 - 5 Volt range is usable at
this point, so ignore the other two ranges as these are for future use...

Below is a HEX dump of the above code and could have been used to POKE the
values into memory to make the whole BASIC code ENTIRELY BASIC but I decided
to use the ~PARAPORT.DAT~ file instead for ease of typing into the BASIC code.

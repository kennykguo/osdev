  USB Keyboard Input/Output for machines that do not have Serial and/or
  Parallel Ports. It gives 2, (out of a possible 4), bits real time INPUT
  and 2, (out of a possible 3), bits toggled OUTPUT. It uses the BIOS
  Keyboard Flags address that can be read/written easily by SW using
  MikeBASIC.

  Enjoy finding simple solutions to often very difficult problems.

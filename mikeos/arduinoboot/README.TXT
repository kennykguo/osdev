             Arduino Access For Use With MikeOS 4.1x And Above.
             --------------------------------------------------

  Overview:-
  ----------

This project is a DEMO of how to access the Arduino series of I/O boards
using MikeOS. It is the second in a series of projects for the person who
wants to learn about how to not only write a very simple operating system
but also to build hardware to run on such a restricted environment.

Just because MikeOS only uses 64KB memory does not mean that power cannot
be exracted from it. It can and the fact that the Arduino board is able to
talk to MikeOS means a whole new avenue of experimentation can occur.

Now have some childish fun and learn how to build stuff for yourself, both
hardware, AND, software wise...

  MINIMUM Requirements:-
  ----------------------

  1) Any complete PC with a(n) 80386 CPU, a(n) 80286 MIGHT work too!
  2) 1MB RAM.
  3) A Serial communications port; 9, OR, 25 way ~D~ type connector.
  4) A means of booting into MikeOS, (Floppy Disk, USB key or CDROM).
  5) MikeOS 4.1x.
  6) Any Arduino Experimental Board; USB, OR, Serial types. I use the
     Arduino Diecimila Board for my needs.
  7) A serious machine to program the Arduino board with the '*.PDE' code.
     (Windows Vista, Mac OSX and most Linux flavours.)

Enjoy finding simple solutiuons to often very difficult problems... :)

                                 --------

  1) DISCONNECT any faulty equipment under test from the MAINS supply.
  2) If a DC supply is used do NOT reverse polarity the connections.
  3) Do NOT power up any electronic item until it is safe to do so.
  4) CHECK and RECHECK all of your construction and repair work thoroughly.
  5) Handle ALL tools used with care.
  6) Beware of ALL types of solvents, glues and etching fluids.
  7) NEVER leave a soldering iron switched on unattended.
  8) KEEP everything OUT of the reach of small children.
  9) Switch OFF the computer before disconnecting or connecting any hardware.
 10) And finally read 1) to 9) again.

  Overview:-
  ----------

This is a basic Test Card Generator to assist in old analogue monitor
geometry, convergence and colour adjustments. It is all done at the
equivalent of CGA level so that ALL CRT style colour monitors can be tested
and serviced to at least a known standard.

It is just the Test Card itself and does NOT include separte Red, Green and
Blue screens, Crosshatch and Centre Cross, Colour Bar and Greyscale plus
many others. If you like what you see and would like me to develop a serious
test tool for MikeOS then Email me using the address below...

Enjoy finding simple solutiuons to often very difficult problems... :)


            Semi-Professional Quality Colour Test Card Generator.
            -----------------------------------------------------

  Preface:-
  ---------

A basic engineering tool for MikeOS 4.0x and higher issued as PD, (Public
Domain), to MikeOS. Original copyright goes to (C)2010, B.Walker, G0LCU.

  Overview:-
  ----------

(Apologies for any "typos" and/or grammar errors that exist as this manual
has NOT been checked for either.)

This is a basic Test Card Generator to assist in old analogue monitor
geometry, convergence and colour adjustments. It is all done at the
equivalent of CGA level so that ALL CRT style colour monitors can be tested
and serviced to at least a known standard.

It is just the Test Card itself and does NOT include separte Red, Green and
Blue screens, Crosshatch and Centre Cross, Colour Bar and Greyscale plus
many others. If you like what you see and would like me to develop a serious
test tool for MikeOS then Email me using the address below...

I`m assuming, (one must never make assumptions), that you are trying out
MikeOS for fun and using an old "PC" connected to a CRT, Cathode Ray Tube),
style monitor.

You will probably need to adjust this monitor and this basic test tool will
be of great help in doing so.

It looks like a little the old UK Channel 4 Test Card and was built up
using the STANDARD CGA character set that MikeOS uses by default.

Enjoy finding simple solutiuons to often very difficult problems... :)

  The CRT Display:-
  -----------------

When the program is running the display will show many things and I will
describe each section so that inexperienced hands can understand what is
going on.

SAFETY is of paramount importance and IF you are competetent enough to
remove the rear cover of display for access of the more subtle controls then
take extreme care when doing so.

  BEWARE!!!
  ---------

DO NOT REMOVE THE REAR COVER UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!
SERIOUS LETHAL VOLTAGES EXIST AND ONE ERROR WILL PROBABLY END UP FATALLY!!!

NORMALLY there should be enough control over the image from the front panel
adjustable controls so stick to these for setting up if possible.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Different Parts Of The Displayed Image:-
  --------------------------------------------

  NOTE:-
  ------

The notes below do not describe very subtle errors in any one display but is
intended for the person with limited or no knowledge of the technicalities of
using pattern generators for setting up displays.

  1) Nearly all the way around the edge of the image is a white border along
     with some other colours. This is purely to set up the centre position
     of the display and possibly height and width. Use any controls to place
     the image centrally and of the full width and height.
  2) Next there is a YELLOW/RED/YELLOW block at the top of the display. If
     these colours are wrong then there is a fault. This block should look
     bright and sharp. Use the brighness, contrast and colour controls for
     the best looks.
  3) Also there is a bright white horizontal line and vertical bars on a
     light grey background to check basic display linearity and convergence.
     This line IS offset slightly inside the light grey area. This is NOT a
     fault but a limitation of CGA "graphics" and my coding... :)
     Use the pincushion, barrel, trapezoidal and other convergence controls
     if required for the best results. Note, ONLY, IF required.
  4) Next there is a bright white block, a black block with a white vertical
     line in it and another bright white block. The white vertical line
     should be bright and sharp and the white blocks should look recatangular
     without any trapezoidal effects. Use the brighness and contrast controls
     if required to help in correcting this, ONLY IF it is very noticable.
  5) Next is the checkerboard of black and light grey blocks. This can be
     ignored as it is for far more subtle errors than can be detected by
     the average person.
  6) Next is the colour bar burst for basic colour checks, more subtle
     errors can be ignored as it is beyond the scope of this basic manual to
     describe. Use the colour, hue and other controls for the best colours.
     These colours are left to right; YELLOW, CYAN, GREEN, MAGENTA, RED and
     BLUE and should be bright and sharp.
  7) Next is the linearity grating block. This is a block of bright white
     horizontal lines and vertical bars used as a reference to correct any
     linearity errors. Use the linearity and convergence controls to correct
     any errors.
     Note that the the central horizontal line IS in the centre of the
     vertical section of the screen and the thicker vertical bar in the
     centre IS at the centre of the horizontal section of the screen as a
     reference point.
  8) Next is the frequency grating section. There are four levels from Low
     frequency on the left hand side to High(ish) frequency on the right hand
     side. These are bright white vertical bars and lines and should be sharp
     and clear. These gratings check the frequency_response/bandwidth of the
     monitor in use and there are NO user controls to adjust this.
  9) Next is the greyscale check. These are in theory different levels
     of grey, (black to white), in equal porgressive steps. Use the
     brightness and contrast controls for the best results.
 10) The last area contains yet another linearity grating block along with
     a BLUE box with bright WHITE text inside. Use the same controls as parts
     1) and 2) to finish off the display linearity, convergence, colours
     brighness and contrast as required.

Well that is all there is to it... :D

This is a basic test card only but, there are serious hardware engineering
tools around at the time of writing, 24-01-2010 that do much more, AND, in
this archive is an ancient MS-DOS software version of these hwardware tools
I wrote nineteen, 19, or so years ago. This generates just about every
pattern needed to set up analogue monitors at CGA level.

For a very serious AMIGA/WinUAE TestCard Generator that is capable of 6400
by 4800 at 8 colours only then download...

             http://aminet.net/package/docs/hard/TestCardRTG

This is an enhanced README showing everything that is inside the archive.

This includes a Windows version, that is not mine, and an enhanced MS-DOS
version, that is mine, of the above pattern generator.

  Notes On The Code:-
  -------------------

This code just loads the assembly language display image and adds a keyboard
holding routine before returning to MikeOS.

It also POKEs the correct values for any offsets required so as to prevent
crashes. The REM statments should be enough to guess what is going on...

The assembly code further down in this manual was compiled using the A86/D86
combination for MS-DOS. It works fine in an MS-DOS, (windowed), Prompt from
Windows Vista. I have no idea if this combination works in later versions
of Windows MS-DOS Prompts however...

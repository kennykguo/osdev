; Bootloader for a simple operating system
; This code represents a minimal boot sector that demonstrates basic system initialization
; and interaction with BIOS interrupts

; Origin and Bit Mode Configuration
; Set the memory origin to 0x7C00 -> this is where the bootloader is loaded into RAM
org 0x7C00        
; This is the standard memory address where BIOS loads the first sector of a bootable device
; Ensures that all memory references are relative to this address

; Specify 16-bit real mode 
; x86 systems start in 16-bit mode when booting
; This mode allows direct hardware access and compatibility with older systems
bits  16

; Preprocessor Macro for End of Line
%define ENDL 0x0D, 0x0A  ; Define a macro for end-of-line (newline)
; FAT12 File System Boot Block Header
; These fields are required by the FAT12 file system specification
jmp short start   ; Short jump to skip over the header 
                  ; Ensures that the header data isn't interpreted as executable code
nop               ; No operation - used for alignment and compatibility with some BIOSes

; C = LBA รท (HPC ร SPT)
; H = (LBA รท SPT) mod HPC
; S = (LBA mod SPT) + 1
; C, H and S are the cylinder number, the head number, and the sector number
; LBA is the logical block address
; HPC is the maximum number of heads per cylinder (reported by disk drive, typically 16 for 28-bit LBA)
; SPT is the maximum number of sectors per track (reported by disk drive, typically 63 for 28-bit LBA)
; Convert Logical Block Address (LBA) to CHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector)
; This is necessary because older disk systems use CHS addressing
lba_to_chs:
    push ax       ; Save LBA value in AX (LBA will be used for calculations)
    push dx       ; Save DX register (which will be modified during the divisions)
    xor dx, dx    ; Clear DX (it will store remainders in later division steps)
    
    ; Step 1: Calculate the sector number (1-based)
    div word [bdb_sectors_per_track]  ; AX = LBA / sectors_per_track, DX = LBA % sectors_per_track
    
    inc dx        ; Increment DX to make sector 1-based (sectors start from 1, not 0)
    mov cx, dx    ; Store the sector number in CX (CX will hold the final result for sector)
    
    xor dx, dx    ; Clear DX again for the next calculation

    ; Step 2: Calculate the head number (part of the cylinder, within the cylinder's tracks)
    div word [bdb_heads]  ; AX = Cylinder number, DX = Head (LBA / SPT) % heads
    ; Explanation:
    ; Now we divide the quotient from the previous division (AX) by `bdb_heads` (2). 
    ; This gives us the head number. AX will contain the cylinder number, and DX (now in DL) will hold the head number.
    mov dh, dl    ; Move the head number (from DL) into DH (part of the result)
    ; The head number is stored in DL, but we need to place it in DH because we are going to pack the result into CX and DH.

    ; Step 3: Calculate the cylinder number
    mov ch, al    ; Move the low byte of the cylinder number into CH (AX contains the cylinder now)
    shl ah, 6     ; Shift the high byte of the cylinder into the correct position (shift left by 6 bits)
    or cl, ah     ; Combine the high 2 bits of the cylinder (in AH) with the sector number (in CL)
    ; Cylinder is stored in AX after dividing by `bdb_heads`. 
    ; The lower 8 bits of the cylinder are placed in CH (low byte of cylinder), and the higher 2 bits of the cylinder are moved into CL, combining it with the sector number.
    ; Final Result:
    ; - CX will contain the combined cylinder and sector (in a packed form).
    ; - DH contains the head number.
